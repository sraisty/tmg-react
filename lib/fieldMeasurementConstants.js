// Increments for the PV & HJ are not specified, but USATF specifies

// competitor left, and the raising interval must be at 2cm+ for HJ
// and 5cm+ for PV.

// NCAA
// For HJ: Recommends raising in 5cm incerments, and never less than 3cm
// For PV: Recommends raising in 15cm  increments and never less than 5cm
// All field event measurements are in Metric, to the nearest lesser centimeter


// NHFS
