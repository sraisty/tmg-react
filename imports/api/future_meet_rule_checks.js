  // Not enough time to run meet, if assuming the event-lineup
  // and typical or user-settable "min times" for each heat

  // Sessions aren't balanced (too much time for morning
  // session, too little time in afternoon) to fit theh events

  // multiple sections required for 3000 or longer, within a gender

  // waves (concurrent schedItems with different start times) are
  // allowable?  (like middle school for the mile)

  // hurdle-events-of-same-height-not-clustered
  // eg: boys and girls have different height hurdles for both
  // hurdle events. Even if all other events go BoyFS,
  // GirlFS, BoyJV, GirlJV, BoyV, GirlV, you probably want to
  // have all Girl's events  in a row then all boys, to avoid
  // switching hurdle heights unnecessarily

  // not enough time to set up hurdles or steeplechase
